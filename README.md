Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my project!

This is an e-commerce project I created as part of an assignment for Sir Ameen Alam and the Gaiaic team.
The project, called Furniro, is a modern and fully responsive e-commerce website with a total of 9 pages.

<h2> Key Highlights:</h2>


Built using Next.js 15 for a smooth, fast, and scalable experience.
Styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean and consistent design.
GSAP animations for that extra wow factor, adding life to the user interface.
The entire design is based on a Figma template, and I’ve carefully followed it to match the provided layout and style guidelines.
I’m really proud of how this turned out, and I believe it offers a seamless user experience across all devices
